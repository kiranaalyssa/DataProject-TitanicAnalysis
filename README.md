# Titanic Disaster Analysis Project
**🚢 About This Project:**

This project was created to complete the Data Science course (*Digital Skill Fair 31.0*) from Dibimbing. It analyzes data from the Titanic disaster to find valuable insights about passenger survival patterns and other influencing factors.

**🌐 Project Goal:**

Using the Titanic dataset, I performed basic data processing (collecting and cleaning data) and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand what factors might affect passenger survival. The findings are visualized to make it easier for us to understand, and by conducting data analysis like this, we can easily uncover valuable information that was previously hidden.
